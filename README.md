# Topic Land

**TopicLand** is the tool to manage and explore topics with knowledge graphs and so on.

It is recommanded to record and explore complex topics such as *novels*, *movies*, *TV series* and *games*.

* Clarify the relations of characters with [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph).
* Use [PageRanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) or other algorithms to select out the prominent roles. 
* Find the shortest path or all paths with [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for any characters.
* Persistent your knowledge graphs for custom topics and share with others.
